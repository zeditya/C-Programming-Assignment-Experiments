C Programming Assignment Experiments

This repository contains a collection of C programs written for a programming assignment. The programs are simple, well-commented, and designed to demonstrate fundamental C programming concepts for beginners.

The experiments are organized into five sets, covering the following topics:

Topics Covered

Experiment Set 1: Basic C Programs

Printing "Hello World"

Variables, data types, and memory addresses

Basic input/output with printf() and scanf()

Simple arithmetic and the modulo operator (sum of digits)

Storing and displaying simple records (Product, Book, Mobile Phone info)

Experiment Set 2: Control Statements and Operators

for and while loops (multiples of 3 or 5)

if...else if...else logic (quadratic roots, largest of three)

Modulo operator for logic (even/odd)

Ternary operator

Common algorithms (Palindrome, Armstrong, Fibonacci)

Nested loops for pattern printing

switch statements (simple calculator)

Demonstrations of all C operators (Logical, Bitwise, Assignment, etc.)

Experiment Set 3: Functions

Creating and using functions

Parameters and return values (area of a circle)

void functions (displaying data)

Using pointers to modify variables from a function (employee data entry)

Using global variables to maintain state (simple banking system)

Experiment Set 4: Arrays

Single-dimensional arrays (finding second largest, counting elements)

Iterating through arrays to analyze data (positive/negative/odd/even)

Searching in an array (frequency of a number)

Two-dimensional arrays (matrix multiplication)

Experiment Set 5: Variables and Scope

Global Scope: Understanding variables accessible to all functions.

Local Scope: Understanding variables private to a single function.

Block Scope: Understanding variables local to a specific if statement or loop.

How to Compile and Run

Each program is a standalone .c file. You can compile and run any of them using a C compiler like gcc (GNU C Compiler).

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the file you want to run.

Compile the program (e.g., program_to_add.c):

gcc program_to_add.c -o program_to_add


Run the compiled executable:

./program_to_add
